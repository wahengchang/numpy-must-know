## Update
 - Tuples are immutable which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. 
 - You are able to take portions of existing tuples to create new tuples.

## Delete
 - Removing individual tuple elements is not possible.

## Basic Tuples Operations
+, *, len(), existed(), loop()

## Built-in Tuple Functions
`cmp(tuple1, tuple2)`, `len(tuple)`, `max(tuple)`, `min(tuple)`, `tuple(seq)`
